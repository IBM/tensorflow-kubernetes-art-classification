# Build your data using Google Bigquery and the Met Art collection


## 1. Install the bigquery client

You may consider setting this up in a virtualenv:

	virtualenv --system-site-packages .
	source bin/activate

Refer to the [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/libraries) for Bigquery:

	pip install --upgrade google-cloud-bigquery




## 2. Install the Google Cloud SDK

Refer to the [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/) for the SDK.
For the Mac, download from this site:

	google-cloud-sdk-168.0.0-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz

Unpack this and run the command:

	./google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud init

   This will open your browser for you to log into the gmail account and to choose your project in Google cloud:

	<your-project-name>

   Authenticate for the client by:

	./google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud auth application-default login

## 3. Run a query

Modify the script `bigquery.py` as appropriate and launch:

	python bigquery.py
